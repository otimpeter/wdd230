            <h2>Our Background and History</h2>
            <p> The Bountiful food has been providing supplemental food to low income families in south Davis County, Utah for over 40 years. We began operating 
                in the 1970s out of a small closet. Driven by need, we have expanded to now serve all of Davis County and operate a 7,500 square foot warehouse.
                 We receive and collect donated food from local grocery stores, the Utah Food Bank, local food producers and private individuals.
                 We sort, organize, store and distribute more than 2,000,000 pounds of food, or roughly 1,700,000 meals, each year, without charge, 
                 to the low income families living in Davis County. In FY22, our marketplace served 10,000 household visits between our market and mobile pantries.

                 In providing supplemental food to our clients and learning about their individual needs, we have found that most face numerous obstacles and that providing supplemental 
                food is not enough to alleviate their suffering and help them move towards greater self-sufficiency. In our quest to help address these issues, we found that there are 
                existing programs and resources available but they were not being fully utilized due to lack of accessibility, lack of awareness of the programs, or inability to navigate 
                the multiple facets of the enrollment process. Our client services begin with an enhanced client intake process to identify any special needs or circumstances, and try to 
                assist in meeting those needs by referrals to assistance programs and partnering with other aid organizations wherever possible as we focus on providing immediate hunger 
                relief. We have arranged shelter for women threatened with domestic violence; assisted with enrollment in Davis Technical College; partnered with Davis Technical College
                and area dental professionals to assist with meeting urgent dental needs; helped with transportation needs; and provided vouchers for use at Deseret Industries.
